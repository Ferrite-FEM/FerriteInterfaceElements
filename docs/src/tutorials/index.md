# Tutorials

On this page you find a collection of example problems as tutorials on how
FerriteInterfaceElements can be used. The tutorials are organized in the same way as for
[Ferrite](https://ferrite-fem.github.io/Ferrite.jl/stable/tutorials/).If you are new to
Ferrite, you should start there to learn the basics.

##### [Tutorial 1: Heat equation](heat_equation.md)

This tutorial shows the basics steps using the heat equation as am example case for a
scalar problem. A square domain with two phases is considered: a matrix with particle
inclusions. First, the required cells at the interface are inserted, then all steps to
colve the problem are presented. Finally, a visualization is generated using Makie.

**Keywords**: scalar-valued solution, Dirichlet boundary conditions, 
inserting interface cells, visualization using Makie.
